<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# **About The Project**



# Feeling overwhelmed by your digital life? Enter Pandorable!

Pandorable, your adorable panda companion designed to simplify your day, offers a delightful blend of intuitive features and helpful functionalities built with Python's **tkinter** library for a user-friendly graphical interface. But Pandorable goes beyond the basics! 

**Here's how Pandorable works:**

- **Enhanced GUI:**  Pandorable utilizes a custom tkinter library to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that goes beyond the standard look and feel.

- **Advanced Gaze Detection:**  Leveraging the power of **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, Pandorable keeps an eye on your privacy. This advanced gaze detection system utilizes your computer's webcam to identify when someone approaches your screen. When someone else is looking into user's laptop, Pandorable alerts you with a spooked panda indicator, allowing you to discreetly protect your privacy.

- **Effortless Image Handling:** Pandorable seamlessly integrates the **Pillow** library for efficient management of image files, ensuring smooth operation and a visually pleasing experience.

**Pandorable's Features:**

- Built-in Break Reminders: Don't let screen fatigue take over! Pandorable gently reminds you to take breaks and offers relaxing activities to keep your mind and body refreshed. From mindful exercises to calming music suggestions curated by a built-in Lofi music player, Pandorable prioritizes your well-being.

- Customizable Toolbar:  Access a variety of features with a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+H). This handy toolbar puts you in control, offering:

    - Relaxing Games: Take a break and unwind with a selection of casual games designed to de-stress and rejuvenate.
    - To-Do List: Stay organized and manage your tasks with a built-in to-do list, ensuring you stay on top of your goals.

**- Easy Toggling:**  The same keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+H) acts as a toggle for the entire application. Launch the gaze detector, access the toolbar, and close everything again with this convenient combination.
